# eBay Product Collector

Chrome extension that lets you capture product data from an eBay listing, tweak the details inside the popup, and send everything straight to your WooCommerce dropshipping endpoint.

## How it works

1. The extension icon only activates on URLs that look like `ebay.co.uk/itm/*`.
2. When you open the popup it injects a content script, scrapes the item ID, title, HTML description, price, stock message, and image URLs, then shows them in an editable form.
3. On import, the popup sends the edited payload to the background service worker which forwards it to your private WooCommerce endpoint, attaching the API key that you store in the extension options page.

The implementation follows the requirements in `Chrome Extension PRD – "eBay Product Collector"` and is designed to work alongside the WordPress plugin described in `WordPress Plugin PRD – "eBay Dropship Sync"`.

## Local development

1. Visit `chrome://extensions`, enable **Developer mode**, and load the `extension` folder as an unpacked extension.
2. Open the extension options page and enter your WooCommerce import endpoint plus the API key generated by your WordPress plugin.
3. Browse to an eBay listing, click the extension icon, review/edit the scraped data, and press **Import to WooCommerce**.

> The background script calls your endpoint via `fetch` with a JSON body and an `X-Api-Key` header. Adjust `scripts/background.js` if your authentication header differs.
